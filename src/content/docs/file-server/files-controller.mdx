title: File Server Files Controller
description: Overview of the files controller
---
The files controller is the main controller for the file server API. It handles all requests to the API, and is responsible
for pretty much everything that the file server is used for. It handles requests to get the file system, upload files,
download files, and delete files.

## Directory Structure
The first thing the files controller does is check to make sure it has access to the Cyrious Control file system. If it doesn't,
it will log an error and any requests trying to get files will fail. The file path is hard coded in the [config](/file-server/config/)
file and rarely changes, but could change if the IP address of the NAS that the Cyrious Control file system is stored on
changes.

If this happens enough that it annoys you, you could consider changing file server to check the database for this path instead.
This is done by Control Sync in `ControlFolderManagementService.GetFolderDocumentRoot`, but was not done in File Server
because it is not a common occurrence.

Below is what the expected file structure looks like

import FileTree from '../../../components/file-tree.astro';

<FileTree>
    - [NAS server IP]/Control/Documents/
        - Estimate/  This is where existing Estimates are found
        - Order/  This is where existing Orders are found
        - Default Folders/  This is where the default file structures for new orders and estimates are stored
            - Order/
            - Estimate/
</FileTree>

## Session Validation
The files controller requests all require the Salesforce session token to be passed as part of the request. Then we cal
`FilesController.ValidKey` to validate that the session is legitimate before allowing the request to continue.

To do this, we call the Salesforce SOAP API pretending to be the user that is logged in and requesting their information.
If the session is valid, we will get back the user's information. If it is not valid, we will get back an error. If the
session belongs to a valid user, we cache their session token as valid for 8 hours to prevent this fairly expensive call
from being made every time a request is made.

## Displaying the File System
Another piece of information that Salesforce sends us is the ID of the order or estimate that the user is currently viewing.
We use this to find the path to the file system for that order or estimate. This depends on us having the ID of the Salesforce
object mapped to the Control object in our `IdReference` table. If we don't have this mapping, we won't be able to find
the file system, and we'll error out. We should always have this mapping though, unless synchronization is broken.

### `create-structure/{key}`
If we can't find the file system because it does not exist, we allow the user to create the file system themselves. This is
done simply by copying the Default Folders folder to the correct location and naming it appropriately. This shouldn't happen
as much anymore, but used to be necessary because Control Sync wouldn't always successfully do this when it was supposed to.
