title: Control Sync
description: Overview of the main Control Sync app
---

Control Sync is a Windows service that runs in the background on a Hansen Signs server. It is the main service that synchronizes
data between Cyrious Control and Salesforce.

Control Sync is configured through the Windows task scheduler on the host machine to automatically
restart daily to deal with occasional seemingly random synchronization issues that were occurring.

:::note
These errors may have been occurring because of the CometD service in Control Sync which has since been moved to hansen-stream.
It's unclear if the service still needs to be occasionally restarted or not.

## IDs
Control Sync uses IDs to keep track of data in both Control and Salesforce. These IDs are used to match data between the two
systems and are stored in the `IdReference` table of the Control Sync database. We have methods that allow us to convert
between the two IDs and store them in the database. We also have to try to keep in mind that data in Control might not
be in Salesforce and try to find it in the Control DB if we don't find a mapping in the `IdReference` table, before we
create a new record in Control, if it makes sense to do that.

## Data Synchronization: Salesforce to Control
Control Sync gets data change notifications from hansen-stream which is a node app that uses CometD to poll for changes
in Salesforce.

When a change is detected, Control Sync will check for the corresponding data in Control and update it
if it exists or add it if it doesn't. It does this by having a direct connection to the Control database and using the
<a href="http://control.cyriouswiki.com/SQL+Bridge" target="_blank">Cyrious Control SQL Bridge</a> to make changes to the database in a way that
Control can understand and pick up on automatically in real-time.

[Topics](/control-sync/topics/) are Salesforce objects that can be subscribed to in order to listen for data updates. Topics
are created and updated through Control Sync but subscribed to through hansen-stream, which forwards the information to
Control Sync.


## Data Synchronization: Control to Salesforce
Control Sync also synchronizes data from Control to Salesforce. This is done by querying the Control database for
changes in the data and then updating the corresponding Salesforce objects.

Control Sync uses `ControlDbPollService` to iterate through classes that implement `IControlPoll` and are registered in
its constructor (at the time of this writing, just `TransactionHeaderPoller`) and executes their `PollForUpdates` method,
which is up to the implementing class to determine how to handle, but generally polls related DBs for changes and executes
update code if something new has been added or updated since the last poll time.

`ControlDbPollService` also handles updating the last poll time in the database for each `IControlPoll` object that runs,
allowing the next poll to only check for changes since the last poll time. `ControlDbPollService` currently runs every
10 seconds, which is determined by the constant class variable `PollTimeoutInMs`.

Generally, any `IControlPoll` class should filter out changes that come from Salesforce to prevent infinite update cycles.
This is possible because updates that come from Salesforce should indicate that their `ModifiedByComputer` is Salesforce,
allowing the polling query to ignore them.

## Control Entities
To make it easier to sync data to and from Control, several classes have been created from their Control database counterparts.
These classes are in `HansenControlSync/Services/Control/ControlEntities` and were manually created to match the database. If
the database changes, these classes will need to be updated to match, though generally only the properties we care about need to
match. Many of the entities will have all the properties from their respective table but not use them all because we didn't
know what we needed at the time.

## Stored Procedures
Control Sync uses [many stored procedures](/control-sync/stored-procedures/) to make changes to the Control database. These stored procedures are located in
`HansenControlSync/Services/Control/StoredProcedures` and are generally named after the procedure they contain. The `StoredProcedureService`
in the same folder is responsible for verifying each procedure exists and creating it if not.

The `StoredProcedureService` can also be used to drop the existing procedures and recreate them if needed, this can be
done manually by setting the `reset` variable in the [config](/control-sync/config/) file to `true` and starting the service.
Just make sure you change it back to `false` before starting the service a second time or it will drop the procedures and
recreate them again unnecessarily. This can be useful for debugging stored procedures.

:::caution
The `reset` variable also deletes and recreates Topics in Salesforce. This shouldn't have any adverse effects, but will
make the startup process slower.

## Stream Client
The stream client is a service responsible for managing [hansen-stream](/hansen-stream/architecture/). It is responsible for
starting and stopping the service and restarting it if it crashes. It also connects to hansen-stream's TCP server and notifies
individual `TopicManagers` when data they care about gets changed.

This functionality used to be built in to Control Sync, but was moved to hansen-stream to make it easier to manage and
due to the CometD service completely breaking and no longer receiving updates from Salesforce. This was the chosen solution
over updating all of HansenControlSync and its dependencies to the latest versions of .NET, which seemed to be the only
way to get CometD to start working in .NET again.

## Logging
Control Sync logs both standard log output and error log output through Log4Net. The log files will be located in the same
directory as the executable and both types of log files will roll so they don't consume too much disk space, but the error
logs are currently allowed to consume more space than the normal logs to help track down errors that may have occurred in the past.

All of the various settings for the log files are available to be changed in the [config](/control-sync/config/) file.
