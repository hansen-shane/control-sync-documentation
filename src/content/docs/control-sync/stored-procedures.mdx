title: Control Sync Stored Procedures
description: Overview of stored procedures for controlling the sync process
---
The stored procedures referred to in this section and throughout Control Sync refer to stored procedures in the Cyrious
Control database. All the stored procedures currently used were created by Cyrious and found in their wiki, most are
unmodified from their wiki state, though some may have been changed or parameters added for Control Sync's purposes.

We have a `StoredProcedureService` which verifies that the stored procedures exist in the database. If they do not exist,
the service will create them during the startup of Control Sync. You can also set `reset` to `true` in the [app config](/control-sync/config/)
to force stored procedures to update by being deleted and re-created during startup.

All stored procedures created this way implement `ICreateStoredProcedure`, have a const string `ProcedureName` property,
and be listed in the `StoredProcedureService`'s `StoredProcedures` list. This allows the service to verify that the
stored procedures exist in the database and create them if they do not.

Below I will go over each currently implemented stored procedure, what it does, and where and how it's used.

## <a href="https://control.cyriouswiki.com/sql_stored_procedure_-_convert_estimate_to_order" target="_blank">csp_ConvertEstimate</a>
> The stored procedure can be used to convert an Estimate to an Order in Control

This is used in `ControlOpportunityManager.ConvertEstimateToOrder` to convert an estimate to an order in Control after
the estimate has been converted to an order in Salesforce. This happens when an opportunity is marked as `Closed Won`.

This is currently a hard coded check in `ControlOpportunityManager.ManageOpportunityData`, which is called by the `OpportunityTopicManager`
when data is updated in Salesforce.

## <a href="https://control.cyriouswiki.com/sql_stored_procedure_-_convert_estimate_to_order" target="https://control.cyriouswiki.com/sql_stored_procedure_-_import_estimate?s[]=csp&s[]=importestimate">csp_ImportEstimate</a>
> The stored procedure can be used to add an estimate in Control

This is used in `ControlOpportunityManager.InsertOrUpdateEstimate` when an opportunity is approved to create a new Estimate in Control
from the opportunity data in Salesforce. Called from `ControlOpportunityManager.ManageOpportunityData`, which is called by the
`OpportunityTopicManager` when data is updated in Salesforce.

When an opportunity is updated (as in, it already exists in Control), we don't use a store procedure and instead update the data manually.

## <a href="https://control.cyriouswiki.com/sql_stored_procedure_-_import_line_item?s[]=csp&s[]=importlineitem" target="_blank">csp_ImportLineItem</a>
> This stored procedure imports a line item into an existing order or estimate.

This is solely used by the above stored procedure, [`csp_ImportEstimate`](/control-sync/stored-procedures/#csp_importestimate).
It's not used directly in Control Sync, but is required for creating Estimates from Salesforce data. We have it managed by
the `StoredProcedureService` so that it's available for csp_ImportEstimate to use and because we felt like it was a better
practice to have one stored procedure per file.
