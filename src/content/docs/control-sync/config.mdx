title: Control Sync Config
description: Overview of the Control Sync config file
---

Control Sync uses .NET 4.5's config file system. The config file is an XML file located in the same directory as the Control
Sync executable and is named `App.config` or `App.release.config` depending on if you're referencing the production config
file or the debug config.

## App Settings
The following keys are available `appSettings` in the Control Sync config file:
- **salesforce_client_id**: The client ID of the Salesforce Connected App
- **salesforce_client_secret**: The client secret of the Salesforce Connected App
- **salesforce_acc_username**: The username of the Salesforce user to use for authentication
- **salesforce_acc_password**: The password of the Salesforce user to use for authentication
- **salesforce_acc_security_token**: The security token of the Salesforce user to use for authentication. Obtained from
user's settings -> generate new security token -> sent to user's email.
- **salesforce_login_url**: The URL to use for Salesforce authentication. Used to automatically get the bearer token required
for the Salesforce REST API, but mainly required for passing to `hansen-stream` so it can subscribe to topics.
- **salesforce_soap_login_url**: The URL to use for Salesforce SOAP authentication. Used any time we need to use the SOAP API.
- **streaming-api-command-start**: The command to run when starting `hansen-stream`. We use pm2 to run `hansen-stream` and
currently this command is configured to start pm2 with the `hansen-stream` process.
- **streaming-api-command-stop**: The command to run when stopping `hansen-stream`. This is currently configured to stop
the `hansen-stream` process in pm2.
- **reset**: Whether to drop and recreate stored procedures and Salesforce PushTopics when starting Control Sync. This is
useful for development, but should be set to false in production to prevent unnecessary startup delays.
- **cyrious_doc_dir**: This is pretty much only used in debugging. It's the directory where Cyrious documents are stored.
This is normally pulled directly from the Cyrious database, but if you're debugging and don't have access to the Cyrious
database, you can set this to a directory on your local machine and Control Sync will use that instead.

## Connection Strings
The following connection strings are available in the Control Sync config file:
- **Control**: The SQL server connection string for the Cyrious Control database. This is the actual Cyrious Control database
that is used by the Cyrious Control application.
- **ControlSync**: The SQL server connection string for the Control Sync database. This database is used only by Control
Sync to manage data related to synchronizing data between Salesforce and Control, such as ID mappings and last poll time.

## log4net
This section is the log4net configuration. It's pretty standard and you can find more information about it on the
<a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4net/" target="_blank">log4net website</a>. The only thing that's really worth
noting is that we use rolling error and console log files. The error log files get to use more storage because they're
generally more important and verbose.
