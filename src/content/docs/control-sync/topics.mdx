PushTopics are (deprecated) <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_streaming.meta/api_streaming/pushtopic_events_intro.htm" target="_blank">Salesforce objects</a>
that are created by Control Sync during startup (either the very first startup or any startup with [`reset`](/control-sync/config/#app-settings) set to true). Topics
are used to listen for data changes from Salesforce and react to them.

:::note
PushTopics are deprecated by Salesforce in the sense that they are no longer recommended for new development. They will
not gain new functionality or be improved in the future. However, they are still supported and used by Control Sync.
:::

## Defining a PushTopic
PushTopics are defined in ControlSync by creating a class that inherits from `ITopicHandler`. `ITopicHandler` classes
need to implement both `CreateTopic` and `OnMessage` that are used to create the PushTopic and handle the incoming
messages respectively.

After definition, topics need to be added to the autofac container builder and then to the `_topics` array in the TopicManagerService.
Topics should have a public static string `Key` that they use to identify themselves in the `_topics` array. This key is
used to start and stop topics and identify them when they receive a message.

After setting up PushTopics in Control Sync, you'll need to add your new topic to the `streams.json` file in `hansen-sync`,
then restart the service.

After that, your new PushTopic will be created and started when Control Sync starts up and listened to by `hansen-sync`,
then the `OnMessage` method will be called when a message is received.
