title: Control Sync Opportunities
description: Overview of the opportunity lifecycle
---
Opportunities in Salesforce are both Estimates and Orders in Cyrious Control, depending on the stage of the opportunity.

When an update comes from Salesforce, the lifecycle state is managed by `ControlOpportunityManager.ManageOpportunityData`,
which has a map of the different available stages and what Control Sync should do at each one.

:::caution
Once an opportunity is marked as won, lost, or voided, it can no longer be updated in Cyrious Control.
At these stages, a new opportunity must be created in Salesforce.

This is a limitation of the way that Cyrious Control works.
:::

## Insert/Update Stages
At these stages, the estimate is only inserted or updated in Cyrious Control. These are early stages of the opportunity lifecycle.

## Closed Won Stage
At the `Closed Won` stage, the opportunity is converted to an order in Cyrious Control.

## Closed Lost Stage
At the `Closed Lost` stage, the order is marked as lost in Cyrious Control.

## Void Stage
At the `Needs Analysis` stage, the order is marked as void in Cyrious Control.

## Unknown Stage
If a stage is added to Salesforce and not handled by this method, the update will be ignored (not even inserting or updating).
There will also be a error log indicating that the stage is not handled.
